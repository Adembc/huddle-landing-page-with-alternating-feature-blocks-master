## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [Normalize](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) - Normalize.css makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards
- [Fontawesome](fontawesome.com) - the web's most popular icon set and toolkit.


### What I learned

#### Some CSS code I am proud of  
```css
.container {
    padding: 0 90px;
    margin: 0 auto; 
    width: 98%;
}
@media (max-width : 992px){
    .container{
    padding : 0 45px ;
}
}
@media (max-width : 767px){
    .container {
        padding: 0 20px;
    }
}
@media (max-width : 767px){
    .access form {
        flex-direction: column; 
        padding: 0 ;
    }
}
```
